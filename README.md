# pi-calculator
A simple demonstration of calculating pi through random (x,y) point selection in ScalaJS

See it in action: https://tylerprete.github.io/pi-calculator/

If you'd like to check out the project and build locally:
1. Check out repository
2. Run ./build.sh from project root
3. open index.html from the public/ directory in a web browser.

Note:
I have this repository auto-wired to build with github actions and auto-deploy updates to the gh-pages branch, updating the site you see above. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!
